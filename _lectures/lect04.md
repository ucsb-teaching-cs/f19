## Goal
* Learn about different debugging techniques
* Debugging tools: gdb, valgrind
* As a tutor you are not expected to debug student code for them, instead you want to guide students to use some of the debugging strategies that you would use if you were actually debugging the code.

UCSB CS grad Alex Ermakov (intern at GreenHills) gave a guest lecture on debugging, we did some in class practice and wrapped up the session with mob debugging this code:
